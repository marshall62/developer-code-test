In order to deploy this thing with mongo db not having to be installed/configed deploy as docker container:
folllowed: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-mongodb
Verify I have docker service:
sudo service docker status
See images:
sudo docker images
Get docker latest image:
sudo docker pull mongo
sudo docker images

There is more to do but this seems promising.   Continue with the configuration after the above.
It seems that I'll have to have at least one docker image but perhaps just this one loaded with the art data
and then flask can talk to it.

This will require the recipient to run some form of docker so I might want to see what those requirements are like before sinking
time into this.
